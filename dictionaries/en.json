        "14": "The number indicates the IT grade. IT grade — size tolerance. There are 20 grades, from IT01 to IT18. The higher the IT grade number, the lower the accuracy. For example, for IT8, the tolerance for any hole or shaft size is 33 µm.",

        "10": "In a transition fit, the tolerance zones of the hole and the shaft overlap partially or completely; therefore, whether there is clearance or interference depends on the actual sizes of the hole and the shaft.",

Систему вала следует применять в экономически обоснованных случаях (например, если на одном гладком валу необходимо установить несколько деталей с отверстиями, имеющими разные отклонения, то применение системы вала позволит упростить обработку вала)."
